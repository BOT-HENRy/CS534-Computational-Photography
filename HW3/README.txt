For 2a.jpg, it is generated by computing the gradient magnitude matrix. The function detects the color change between neighbours in the image. In the picture, the blue color means low energy (the color change from current position to its neighbours are small), the red color means high energy (the color change from current position to its neighbours are big).
For 2b.jpg, it is the picture of cumulative minimum energy. The cumulative minimum energy is calculated from left to right, so look at the picture from left to right, we can see that the color changes from blue to red (from low energy to high energy).

In this picture, the two seams (shown in black) represent the first selected horizontal seam and the first selected vertical seam. When we look at them closely, it is obvious that the colors on these two seams have the mininum change. One is the horizontal seam along the lake and the colors are mostly blue. One is the vertical seam along the lake(colors are mostly blue),road(colors are mostly gray) and grass(colors are mostly green).

In the original picture, the buildings and the boats have very high energy. So the resulting picture looks successful because it shrinks the sky and the river which has low enery, most parts of the buildings and boats remain.

This image has a bad result because for this image, it is very difficult to find good seams to remove. The color changes a lot across the whole picture, which make it very difficult to shrink the picture. After the shrink, we can see that the lights and people all got messed up.
